# Django CV Project Submission

Hello Professor/TA,

Thank you for taking the time to review my CV project. This application is built with Django and is designed to display my professional resume.

The project repository includes the SQLite database (`db.sqlite3`) with all my data, so you can run it directly without any extra configuration. The following steps will guide you through getting the project running on your machine.

## Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Download the Project
First, please clone the project repository to your computer using the terminal.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sc11520/SE-Django-CV-Project.git
```
Second, change the directory to the project folder.
```bash
cd SE-Django-CV-Project
```

### Step 2: Set Up the Environment ###
For a clean and reliable setup, virtual environment with all dependencies for the project are included in the project. Here is the command to activate the venv.

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 4: Run the Project ###
That's it! The project is now ready to run.

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
### How to View My CV ###
The application should now be running on your local server.

1. Please open your web browser and go to: http://127.0.0.1:8000/
2. That should take you directly to home page (i.e http://127.0.0.1:8000/home)
3. Click on the link called 'View CV' which is present on my home page which takes you to my actual cv (i.e http://127.0.0.1:8000/home/cv)
